# Dev Journal

List of things I've done during this development.

## Done on 2023-08-05
1. Followed the [Electron Quick Start guide](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start).
1. Reorganised a bit to enable React, as per [this article by Daniel Katungi](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/desktop-application-with-react/). Not completely, but moved things to public and build folders.
1. [Created a trello to track all the things!](https://trello.com/b/wsWFeb62/edtracker-kanban)
1. [Upgraded Nodejs to v20 on Ubuntu (PopOS)](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#debinstall). 
I needed help from [this stackexchange article](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/627635/upgrading-nodejs-on-ubuntu-how-to-fix-broken-pipe-error), though.
1. Started researching unit testing via https://www.section.io/engineering-education/node-testing/ .
